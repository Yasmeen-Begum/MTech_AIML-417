In the linear search- iterative approach we have taken 3 cases and with the taken for the execution.In the above table we observe that case 1,case 2 and case 3 has taken less time for the execution.The below graph are taken based on the cases and time taken for the execution.The time taken of linear search is increases from case 1 to case 3.

In the Linear search recursive approach have the above contain 3 cases and time taken for the execution.The graph is drawn between the cases and time taken for execution for the 3 cases.we observe that Case 1 taken less time and case 3 has taken more time for the execution.The graph is shown below.
