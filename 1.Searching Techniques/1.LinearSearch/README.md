In the linear search- iterative approach we have taken 3 cases and with the taken for the execution.In the above table we observe that case 1,case 2 and case 3 has taken less time for the execution.The below graph are taken based on the cases and time taken for the execution.The time taken of linear search is increases from case 1 to case 3.
