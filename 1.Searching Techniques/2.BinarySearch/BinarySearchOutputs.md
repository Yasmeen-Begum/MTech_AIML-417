In the Binary search iterative Approach ,we observe that there are the 3 cases and time taken for the execution has taken we can estimate that there is increase of time taken between the cases .The graph for the Binary Search has been plotted based on the time taken for the execution and cases.

In the Binary Search Recursive approach we can observe that for the 3 cases time taken for the execution has been taken.Among 3 cases we can observe that case1 has taken less time than case,case3 .The graph for the above table information is plotted for Binary Search recursive.
