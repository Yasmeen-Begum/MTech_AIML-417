----------
BUBBLE SORT:Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed. These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps had to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements "bubble" up to the top of the list.


Description:In this Bubble sort sorting technique ,we have taken a input array from the files which we have created.For case 1 the input array from file known as " inputFile1.txt" we have created using random function contains random values with the size of 1200 of array.we are reading each characher using fscanf funtion   

-------------------------------
Case 1: All Elements are Sorted
-------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------
Case 2: First 50 % elements are Sorted and remaining Unsorted
-------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------
Case 3: All elements are Sorted but in reverse Order
----------------------------------------------------

In the Bubble sort we have taken 3 cases and calculated with respect to the time taken for the execution .We observe that case 1 has taken less time and case 2 ,case 3 equal amount of time. The graph has plot with respect to time taken and cases.The graph for Bubble sort shown below
