2.INSERTION SORT
----------------

# Description:
In this insertion sort sorting technique ,we have taken a input array from the files which we have created.For case 1 the input array from file known as " inputFile1.txt" we have created using random function it contains random numbers with the size of 1200 of array.we are reading each characher using fscanf funtion performing insertionsort operations.For case 2 we are taking inputFile2.txt as input with array size 1100 and reading that file and  performing operations.For case 3 samething can be done in addition to that we are performing reverse operation on insertionsort.   

-------------------------------
Case 1: All Elements are Sorted
-------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------
Case 2: First 50 % elements are Sorted and remaining Unsorted
-------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------
Case 3: All elements are Sorted but in reverse Order
----------------------------------------------------

2.1 Observation for Insertion sort
----------------------------------
Table 2.1 Comparative analysis of all cases in insertion Sort

From the above table we can observe that , 3 cases has taken time for the execution case1 has taken less time than case 2 and case3 there is 4 times of difference we can observe between the cases .The graph for the Insertion Sort has been plotted.The graph shown below.
