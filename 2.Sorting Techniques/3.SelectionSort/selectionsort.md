3.SELECTION SORT
----------------

# Description
In this selection sort sorting technique ,we have taken a input array from the files which we have created.For case 1 the input array from file known as " inputFile1.txt" we have created using random function it contains random numbers with the size of 1200 of array.we are reading each characher using fscanf funtion performing selectionsort operations.For case 2 we are taking inputFile2.txt as input with array size 1100 and reading that file and  performing operations.For case 3 samething can be done in addition to that we are performing reverse operation on selectionsort.   

-------------------------------
Case 1: All Elements are Sorted
-------------------------------

In the Selection Sort sorting technique we taken 3 Cases and time taken for execution.We observe that from the table in the cases we can see a slight difference with one point. The graph for the selection sort has been plot based on the time taken for the execution and the cases.
