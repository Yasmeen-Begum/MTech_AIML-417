From the above table we can observe that for the 3 cases and time taken for the execution for the
above cases has been given we can see that there is increase in the time taken for the execution
between cases.Case 1 has taken less time than case 2,case 3.Case 3 has taken more than case 1,case
2.The graph for merge sort has been plotted based on cases and time taken for the execution.
