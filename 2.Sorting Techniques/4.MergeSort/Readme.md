Merge sort
----------

# Description
In this Merge sort sorting technique ,we have taken a input array from the files which we have created.For case 1 the input array from file known as " inputFile1.txt" we have created using random function it contains random numbers with the size of 1200 of array.we are reading each characher using fscanf funtion performing merge sort operations.For case 2 we are taking inputFile2.txt as input with array size 1100 and reading that file and  performing operations.For case 3 samething can be done in addition to that we are performing reverse operation on merge sort.   


Case 1 : All Elements are Sorted
--------------------------------

Case 2: First 50 % elements are Sorted and remaining Unsorted
-------------------------------------------------------------

Case 3: All elements are Sorted but in reverse Order
----------------------------------------------------

 4.1 Observation for Merge Sort
 --------------------------
 
 4.1 Table Comparative Analysis of all cases in Merge sort

From the above table we can observe that for the 3 cases and time taken for the execution for the
above cases has been given we can see that there is increase in the time taken for the execution
between cases.Case 1 has taken less time than case 2,case 3.Case 3 has taken more than case 1,case
2.The graph for merge sort has been plotted based on cases and time taken for the execution.
