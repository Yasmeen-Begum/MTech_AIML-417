5.Quick Sort
------------

# Description
In this Quick sort sorting technique ,we have taken a input array from the files which we have created.For case 1 the input array from file known as " inputFile1.txt" we have created using random function it contains random numbers with the size of 1200 of array.we are reading each characher using fscanf funtion performing quicksort operations.For case 2 we are taking inputFile2.txt as input with array size 1100 and reading that file and  performing operations.For case 3 samething can be done in addition to that we are performing reverse operation on quick sort.   



Case 1 : All Elements are Sorted
--------------------------------

Case 2: First 50 % elements are Sorted and remaining Unsorted
--------------------------------------------------------------

 5.1 Observation for Quick Sort
 ------------------------------
 
 Table 5.1 Comparative Analysis of all cases in Quick Sort

From the above table we can observe that for the 3 cases time taken for execution has been taken
we can find that case 1 and case 3 has taken equal amount of time and case 1 is less than case 1,case
3 .The graph for the Quicksort has been plotted based on the table data.
