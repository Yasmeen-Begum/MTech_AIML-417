 # 1.1 Observation for the Searching Techniques

From the above table we can observe that there are 2 sorting techniques which is iterative and recursive we have 3 cases and calculated the time taken for execution.case1 which is element is present at index 0 takes less time where as case 2 which is element is present in middle is taken time some more than case 1 and less than the case 3,case 3 which element is not present in the array has taken more time than the case 2 and case 3.The graph for the above searching techniques has been plotted.we can observe that linear search iterative and recursive has taken less time than the Binary Search iterative and recursive

# 2.1 Observation for Sorting Techniques

From the above table we can observe that there are 5 sorting techniques and 3 cases.For the case 1 we can find that has taken time has been increases between the techniques .For the case 2 there is changes for the time taken between sortings .For case 3 there is a increase in time for sortings.From the 3 cases we can observe that Bubble Sort has taken less time where as Merge Sort has taken more time for sorting among all sorting techniques.The graph for all sortings have been plotted the insertion sort,selection sort,quick sort has taken time between the Bubble sort and Merge sort.The graph for comparative analysis of sorting has been shown below
